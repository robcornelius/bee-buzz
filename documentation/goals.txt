Cornelius.buzz is for beekeepers

It will enable them to keep both automated and manual records of their hives.

It will interface with other sites such as beebase http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/index.cfm

It will enable the aggregation of anonymized statistics across all users and for all users

It will get local weather feeds automatically

It will display data in meaningful ways to all users

It will be simple to use at every level

It will enable beekeeping groups to share records amongst their own group members and also produce aggregated statistics for the group
    Group members only see anonymous stats for their group
    Admins see non-anonymous stats for their group (location, contact details, etc)

It will enable beekeepers to become "friends" with other users
    Friends will be able to share non-anonymised data
    Friends will be able to message one another

It will enable users to see a list of anonymous apiaries in a radius around their apiaries but not see who owns them. They can send freind invites to these apiaries owners.

It will enable users to search for other users by name and add them as friends with no geographical limit.

It will enable users to be members of more than one group

It will enable aggregations by hive type, number of hives in an apiary, number of apiaries a user has etc etc etc

It will enable group admins to add users

It will enable group admins to send messages to the entire group

security is a priority

It will be usuable across all devices from a phone upwards. There will not be an app yet.
