# bee-buzz

This is a project to provide monitoring for a bee hive. It will have a node / express / mongo back end and a react front end.

As a starting point it should include temperature and humidity monitoring provided by a solar powered ardruino / raspberry pi passing data to a REST API sitting in front of a mongo database. The front end will be graphing provided by D3.js and react.

All of this is subject to change
